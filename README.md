I am an RAF Officer, who after becoming dissatisfied with the oppresive nature and the lack of opportunity in the military, decided to leave and start a new career in web development. I am attending the May 2016 cohort of Makers Academy in London with the hope of securing a Junior Developer's job in Bristol in the autumn.
