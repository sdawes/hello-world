Introductory repository to act as an educational and test environment for me to learn how to use GitHub!

I am an Operations Manager, who after becoming dissatisfied with the oppresive nature and the lack of opportunity in my organisation, decided to leave and start a new career in web development. I am attending the May 2016 cohort of Makers Academy in London with the hope of securing a Junior Developer's job in Bristol in the autumn.
